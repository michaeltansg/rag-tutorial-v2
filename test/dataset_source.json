They can choose from the face-up cards or draw blindly from the top of the deck. If a face-up card is chosen, a new card from the deck immediately replaces it face-up.\n\n2. **Claiming a Route:** A player claims a route by playing a set of Train Car cards that match the color and length of the route on the board. Each space on the route must be covered with a card representing that color and setting. For example, a Blue route requires blue-colored Passenger Car cards. Gray-colored routes can be claimed using cards of any one color.\n\n3. **Using Locomotive Cards:** Locomotive cards are multi-colored wild cards that can be used as any color in a set when claiming a route. \n\nThese cards are used to strategically claim routes on the board and earn points throughout the game.",
